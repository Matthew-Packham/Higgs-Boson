# Higgs-Boson

In this project I compare different MLP models to classify the presence of a signal process which produces Higgs boson. I build four models a 'small', 'medium', 'paper' and 'paper regularised'. 

The paper model is a reconstruction of the orginal model used in the paper titled:
* 'Searching for Exotic Particles in High-energy Physics with Deep Learning' Baldi, P., Sadowski, P. & Whiteson, D. (2014).

I then introduce concepts to regularise the papers model - which further increase performance.

I conclude the project with further steps for improving the accuracy.
